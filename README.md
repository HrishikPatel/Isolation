# Isolation

This project only contains one file. Isolation.cs
The following project is tasked with creating a digital version or the two player game called Isolation where each player makes a move each turn to one of their adjacent 
and strategically removes a tile from the board. The person who can't make a move first loses. The other person wins.

The moves in the following program are made by specifying the box to move to and remove in array coordinate system of 4 strings. E.g if string abcd is passed, ab corresponds
to where you want to move your tile and cd corresponds to which tile you want to remove off of the board.
